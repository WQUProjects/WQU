Let's say that our prediction for what's going to happen at 12:00 is based on what happened at 11:00, 10:00, and 9:00. When we move forward an hour to predict what's going to happen at 1:00, we only use data from 10:00, 11:00, and 12:00, dropping the data from 9:00 because it's now too far in the past.

        "# ARMA Models & Hyperparameters\n",
        "**ARMA** stands for Auto Regressive Moving Average, and it's a special kind of **time-series** analysis. So far, we've used autoregression (AR) to build our time-series models, and you might recall that AR models rely on values that remain relatively stable over time. That is, they can predict the future very well, as long as the future looks roughly the same as the past. The trouble with predicting the future is that things can suddenly change, and as a result, the future doesn't look much like the past anymore. These sudden changes — economists call them *endogenous shocks* — can be as big as a hurricane destroying a city or an unexpected increase in the minimum wage, and they can be as small as a new restaurant opening in a neighborhood or a single person losing their job. In our data, the air quality might be changed if there was a nearby forest fire, or if a building collapsed near one of the sensors and raised a giant cloud of dust. \n",

When fitting models, it is possible to increase model performance by adding more parameters, which would also result in overfitting. The BIC resolves this problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model. The penalty term is larger in BIC than in AIC. Though BIC is always higher than AIC, lower the value of these two measures, better the model."

It's not in the form of DatetimeIndex that we desire. So we need to format the forecasts to be more readable.\n",
